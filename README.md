# $F00L.
An open source CLI Terminal made with C++.

# Status:
## Version 1.0.0 (2025. 08. 30)
- Lightweight, 0 customisability, basic commands. If command is not on the `help` (`--help`) list, then it directly uses window's CMD to execute it (this is for other terminal CLI's, like terminal-based code editors).
## Version 1.1.0 (???)
- Coming soon...
